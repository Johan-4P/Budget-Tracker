## Design

### Color Scheme 
I have choose the color based on that fact that i want it to be an clean site

In my css file i have mostly used variables to declare color, and used these throughout the css file.
Its useful to use the same color code if you wish to alter the color on the webpage.
* For the most i have used a linear-gradient(90deg, #007bff, #0056b3); As a background-color
* for the navbar i used : #1e3474;
* And for the text i choose color: white;

![color-scheme](assets/images/color-scheme.png)

### Wireframe 
Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and laptops using balsamiq.

### Accessibility

I have really tried to ensure that the website is as accessible as possible. I have achieve this by doing this:
* Using semantic HTML.
* Using a hover state on all buttons on the site to make it clear to the user if they are hovering over a button.
* Used the fonts because i think them are easily to read for people with dyslexia, and that include my self.
